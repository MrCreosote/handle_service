This captures some notes on the serializable capability of the handle service module.

The cli already has a serialize and deserialize method in all of the command line scripts. This comes by way of bootstrapping the construction of a command using tpage and the script.tt template.

So, what am I looking for? I'm looking for a serialize capability that will serialize a handle to the file system or to the workspace or to what ever underlying storage system the user want (lets throw in accumulo just for giggles).

Let's start by asking how does this look to the user?

The use case is that a user has D directories, each of which contains F fastq.gz files that are to be mappeded to R reference genomes.

a) The user wishes to obtain 1 vcf file for each set of fastq.gz files mapped foreach reference genome.

b) The user wishes to submit the name of the directory, or a file that contains the list of directories.

c) The users wishes to receive the vcf file in the directory that contains the fastq files.

I'm thinking that all output should be in the form of a handle that has been serialized to disk.
