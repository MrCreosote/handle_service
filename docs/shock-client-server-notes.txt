To get shock server running

1. change Makefile to indicate TEST or PROD

2. create directories for TEST or PROD depending on makefile
        mkdir /mnt/Shock/data
        mkdir /mnt/Shock/logs
        mkdir /mnt/Shock/site
        mkdir /mnt/Shock/site/assets
        mkdir /mnt/Shock/site/assets/misc
        mkdir /kb/deployment/services/shock_service
        mkdir /kb/deployment/services/shock_service/conf

3. start the shock server
        source /kb/deployment/user-env.sh
        shock-server -conf=/kb/deployment/services/shock_service/conf/shock.cfg



To get the shock client running

1. need to hand edit the shock-client.cfg file to have the
   location of the shock server and port.

2. you need to put the shock-client.cfg file in your home
   directory right now because the -conf flag doesn't work

2. to run the shock-client
        source /kb/deployment/user-env.sh
        shock-client auth set
        shock-client create
