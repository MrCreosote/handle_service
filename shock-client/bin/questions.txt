Q:	what becomes of create_user.curl. Is that still used? If so, what is a standard workflow that uses it?
A:	SHOCK commands dealing with users are only applicable when SHOCK is a stand-alone tool.  When 
	used with external authentication (e.g. Globus Online), then creating and listing users
	isn't authorized. This is includes both creating, viewing, and listing users.
