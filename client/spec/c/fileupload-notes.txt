The problem is when you want to upload a file.

SOLUTION 1

A solution is use a client call to register the file with the server.

The server then does a http based pull.

The limitations of this strategy is that parallel transfers of chunks is not really possible without a specialized client.

SOLUTION 2

A solution is to do a mulit-part post from the client.

The limitations of this strategy is that a specialized client will be required. A potential solution is a general client lib distributed as part of every client bundle that handles this. There is a special token in the type spec that directs the compiler to insert a file upload. Perhaps this can be a special type "UploadableFile".


funcdef uploadFile(FileName localfile, FileName remotefile) returns (Filesize bytes) isa FileUploader;


SOLUTION 3

A solution is to get an id from the client, and then just do a PUT using curl or whatever you want. This seems to be the solution that our REST advocates would prefer.
